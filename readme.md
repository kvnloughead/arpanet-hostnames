# Arpanet Hostnames Data Cleaning

I am attempting to convert the hostnames lists (and potentially other data) from the [Arpanet Directories](https://www.google.com/books/edition/ARPANET_Directory/AHo-AQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=arpanet+directory&printsec=frontcover)<sup>1</sup> of 1976-78.
It seems that a lot of this information is not readily available in an analyzable format.

<sup>1</sup> This pdf actually contains the directories from 1976-1978, although this is not indicated on the Google books page.
